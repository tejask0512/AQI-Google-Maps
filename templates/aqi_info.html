            <h2>Understanding Air Quality Index (AQI)</h2>
            <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a scale used to communicate how polluted the air is and what associated health effects might be of concern. The AQI focuses on health effects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing polluted air.</p>
